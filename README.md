### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (An array is an ordered list of elements. It is a set of data represented by a single variable name and each piece of data in an array is an element. JavaScript represents arrays with the Array object. Also, getElementsByTagName() returns an array.)
2. (Java and JavaScript are two totally different languages. JavaScript is a loosely-typed language where you do not need to declare a variable. Java is a much more complex programming language and is strongly-typed.)
3. (The three types of data types are primitive, composite, and special. Primitive date types consist of number, boolean, and string. Composite data types consist of object and array. Special data types consist of null, which represents nothing, and undefined, which represents a value of an uninitialized variable.)
